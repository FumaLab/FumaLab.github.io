  description: 'Jonathan was an undergraduate at University of Bayreuth, Germany, where he worked in the lab of Benedikt Westermann on [mitochondrial fusion and fission](/publications#19221197) using yeast as a model system.


  In 2008, he moved to Dresden to do his PhD at the [Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics](http://mpi-cbg.de). He joined the lab of the late [Suzanne Eaton](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/institute/remembering-suzanne/)
  studying the role of [systemically circulating Hedgehog](/publications#25452274) and [steroid hormone signaling](/publications#26395481) during fruit fly development.


  As a postdoc, Jonathan crossed the pond and moved New Haven, USA joining the [Neugebauer lab](https://www.neugebauerlab.com/) at Yale University. He focused his research
  on establishing approaches to the quantitatively measure the energy exchanged between biological systems and their surroundings, and to investigate the metabolism and [energetics costs of early development](/publications#30713074).


  Outside of science, Jonathan plays beer-league hockey and piano and harmonica in the band [Lyon Street Fire](https://www.lyonstreetfire.com/)'
