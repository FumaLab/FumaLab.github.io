<h5><i>WHO WE ARE:</i></h5> We are biologists, biophysicists and bioengineers broadly interested in the evolution of cell and molecular mechanisms. <br>
<h5><i>WHAT WE DO:</i></h5> We study the interplay between genome maintenance mechanisms and evolutionary forces in shaping organismal features.<br>
<h5><i>HOW WE DO IT:</i></h5> We use a multidisciplinary methodology that entails molecular, cellular, evolutionary, and synthetic biology. When possible, we take advantage of quantitative approaches to discriminate amongst different classes of models.
