<h5>WHO WE ARE:</h5> We are biologists and biophysicists, broadly interested in the evolution of cell and molecular mechanisms. <br>
<h5>WHAT WE DO:</h5> We study the interplay between genome maintenance mechanisms and evolutionary forces in shaping organismal features.<br>
<h5>HOW WE DO IT:</h5> We use a multidisciplinary methodology that entails molecular, cellular, evolutionary, and synthetic biology. When possible, we take advantage of quantitative approaches to discriminate amongst different classes of models.
