<h4><b>How do fundamental cellular processes evolve?</b></h4><br>

Early research emphasized universal principles shared across life, but recent studies have uncovered surprising, species-specific differences in how essential functions are carried out. Chromosomes are organized, replicated, segregated, and repaired by diverse molecular assemblies — yet <b>the evolutionary origins of this variability remain poorly understood.</b><br>

We recently showed that genome maintenance mechanisms can rapidly rewire under stress, demonstrating how <b>the evolution of cellular biology is experimentally tractable.</b><br>

Our lab uses <i><b>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</b></i> as a model to study how cells adapt to genome maintenance challenges. We integrate molecular, evolutionary, biophysical, and synthetic biology to uncover the mechanisms that drive cellular evolution — from molecules to populations.<br>

These insights contribute to a broader understanding of the fundamental principles of evolutionary cell biology and have significant implications for predicting evolutionary outcomes in areas such as <b>cancer progression and antibiotic resistance.</b><br>

#### Open Science
We do our best to promote Open Science. Below are a number of initiatives and associations we support:
