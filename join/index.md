We are all scientists, at different levels of our paths, with different interests, but sharing a common passion for scientific discovery.

##### We aim to recruit, at all levels,  individuals which:

1. Are curious about science and biology at large.
2. Are generous and altruistic towards the other members, especially the youngest ones.
3. Contribute to the laboratory diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity and social background.

##### Recruitment calls:

###### <i>Graduate Students</i>
Graduate students are recruited mostly through the [GIMM PhD Program](https://gimm.pt/education-and-training/phd-program/){:target="_blank"} Or the [FCT national Program](https://www.fct.pt/en/financiamento/programas-de-financiamento/bolsas/){:target="_blank"}. Students from external PhD programs can also be considered. Prospective students interested in joining our lab are encouraged to reach out prior to the call deadlines.

###### <i>Postdoctoral Fellows</i>
<u>We have funded positions available!</u> Potential candidates are invited to express their initial interest all year round.

###### <i>Lab Managers and technicians</i>
<u>We are welcoming applications for prospective lab managers and lab technicians.</u> The ideal candidates would have previous experience in microbiology and be willing to learn the common techniques used in the lab.

###### <i>Undergraduate Students</i>
Students can be recruited at the IGC from eligible Portuguese or foreign universities. We encourage foreign students interested in a master at the IGC to take advantage of the [ERASMUS+](https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-individuals/students/traineeship-student){:target="_blank"} program.
