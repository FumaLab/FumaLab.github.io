Our vision is to create fundamental knowledge through curiosity driven, innovative and rigorous science in a developing field at the interphase of biology, chemistry and physics. Without diversity of skills, thought, and experiences, we lessen our ability to ask important questions and solve problems. We strive to create a lab that values and includes people with diverse backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences. Jonathan encourages especially those candidates from under-represented minority backgrounds to apply to join our team. The working language at the institute is English and no knowledge of German is necessary

## Graduate Students
Positions are available for students from a wide range of backgrounds including cell and developmental biology, biophysics, engineering, and physics. Interested students are encouraged to contact Jonathan to discuss possibilities and apply through the [International Max Planck Research School for Cell, Developmental and Systems Biology](http://www.imprs-celldevosys.de/)

## Postdoctoral Fellows
Positions are available for researchers from a wide variety of backgrounds. Applicants are encouraged to suggest new projects, areas of research, or new ideas in their application. We love new ideas and approaches. You might want to apply to the [ELBE postdoc program](http://www.csbdresden.de/join-us/as-a-postdoc/) that aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaborations.

Applicants should email a description of research interests, a CV and the names of three potential references to Jonathan.
