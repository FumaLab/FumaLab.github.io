We are all scientists, at different levels of our paths, with different interests, but sharing a common passion for scientific discovery.

##### We aim to recruit, at all levels,  individuals which:

1. Are curious about science and biology at large.
2. Are generous and altruistic towards the other members, especially the youngest ones.
3. Contribute to the laboratory diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity and social extraction.


###### <i>Graduate Students</i>
Graduate students are recruited through the [Integrative Biology and Biomedicine](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/training/phd-programmes/ibb/) program hosted by the IGC. Candidacies from external PhD programs can occasionally be considered on a case-by-case basis. 

###### Postdoctoral Fellows
Positions are available for researchers from a wide variety of backgrounds.

###### Undergraduate Students
Positions are available for undergraduate students interested in cell biology and evolution.

###### Applicants should email a description of research interests, a CV and the names of three potential references to Marco.
