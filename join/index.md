We are all scientists, at different levels of our paths, with different interests, but sharing a common passion for scientific discovery.

##### We aim to recruit, at all levels,  individuals which:

1. Are curious about science and biology at large.
2. Are generous and altruistic towards the other members, especially the youngest ones.
3. Contribute to the laboratory diversity in terms of gender, ethnicity and social background.

##### Recruitment calls:
###### <i>Graduate Students</i>
Graduate students are recruited through the [Integrative Biology and Biomedicine](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/training/phd-programmes/ibb/){:target="_blank"} program hosted by the IGC. Calls are held yearly in February/March. Prospective students interested in joining our lab are encouraged to reach out prior to the call deadline. Candidacies from external PhD programs can occasionally be considered. 

###### <i>Postdoctoral Fellows</i>
