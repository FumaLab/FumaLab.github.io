We are excited to announce that Jonathans's ERC Starting Grant proposal „Energetics of Biological Systems (EnBioSys)” was successful. This award will allow us to develop non-invasive calorimetry-based approaches to quantitatively measure metabolic rates, especially rates of energy conversion and dissipation in biological systems. We aim to use these approaches to generate quantitative thermodynamic data needed to understand how cells and organisms use energy to stay alive, growth and develop. We have a couple of ERC and MPG funded PostDoc and PhD positions available. (see [join the lab](/join)). Please contact Jonathan for details.
